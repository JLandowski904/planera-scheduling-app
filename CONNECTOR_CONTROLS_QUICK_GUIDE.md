# Quick Guide: Connector Controls

## New Connector Interaction

Your whiteboard connectors now have a **simple, intuitive** control system:

### One Handle to Bend
- Select any connector
- **Blue circle appears in the middle**
- Drag it to bend the connector
- Stays at perfect 90° angles automatically

### Snap to Different Sides
- Select any connector
- **Small squares appear on both nodes**
- Drag a square to snap connector to that side
- Works on both ends (source and target)

## How to Use

### Bend a Connector
1. **Click** on a connector line → it highlights
2. **Grab the blue circle** in the middle
3. **Drag** left, right, up, or down
4. **Release** - connector bends cleanly with 90° turns

### Change Connection Side
1. **Click** on a connector to select it
2. **Gray squares** appear at all four sides of both boxes
3. **Blue squares** show current connection points
4. **Drag a gray square** toward the side you want
5. Connector snaps to nearest side automatically

### Reset to Auto
1. **Right-click** on a connector
2. Select **"Reset to Auto Route"**
3. All custom bends removed
4. Returns to simple default path

## What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Multiple tiny waypoint dots | One big blue midpoint handle |
| Clicking edge added unwanted bends | Clicking only selects |
| Diagonal/jagged segments possible | Always clean 90° angles |
| Controls hidden behind boxes | Always visible at midpoint |

## Visual Guide

```
Task A ──────●────────┐
                      │  ← Blue circle = drag to bend
                      └────→ Task B

Task A ──────●────────┐
             ↑        │
        FS Label      └────→ Task B
        Edit/Delete
```

The ● blue circle is your main control for bending connectors!

## Tips

💡 **Grid Snapping**: Enable grid (if available) for perfectly aligned bends

💡 **One Bend = Clean**: Single bend keeps diagrams readable

💡 **Multiple Edges**: Connect same tasks from different sides to avoid overlaps

💡 **Dark Mode**: All handles visible in both light and dark themes

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the blue circle**
A: Click the connector to select it first

**Q: The connector won't bend**
A: Make sure you're dragging the **blue circle**, not the line itself

**Q: How do I add multiple bends?**
A: The system uses single-bend design for cleaner diagrams. If you need complex routing, adjust the connection sides instead.

**Q: Controls are hidden**
A: They're now at the midpoint, but double-check the edge is selected

**Q: Segments are diagonal**
A: This shouldn't happen! The system enforces 90° angles. If you see diagonal segments, try resetting to auto route.

## What You Can Do

✅ Bend connectors by dragging the midpoint
✅ Change which side connectors attach to
✅ See FS/SS/FF labels clearly
✅ Access edit/delete without hunting
✅ Maintain clean 90° angles automatically
✅ Works in dark mode

## What's Automatic

🔄 Choosing best connection sides (if you don't override)
🔄 Maintaining 90° angles while dragging
🔄 Positioning label at visible midpoint
🔄 Snapping to grid (if enabled)

**Simple. Clean. Orthogonal.**
