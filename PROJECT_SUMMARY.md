- **✅ Dependencies**: Visual connectors with finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish relationships
- **✅ Multiple Views**: Whiteboard, Timeline/Gantt, and Table views
- **✅ Real-time Updates**: Automatic date propagation and conflict detection

### Node Management
- **✅ Drag & Drop**: Move nodes freely on the canvas
- **✅ Resize**: Adjust node dimensions with resize handles

- **✅ Multi-select**: Select and manipulate multiple nodes
- **✅ Marquee Selection**: Click and drag to select multiple items

### Scheduling Features
- **✅ Date Management**: Start dates, due dates, and duration tracking
- **✅ Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for tasks
- **✅ Dependency Types**: Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, Finish-to-Finish
- **✅ Conflict Detection**: Circular dependencies, over-allocation, date conflicts
- **✅ Auto-propagation**: Changes to predecessors automatically update successors

### Construction-Specific Features
- **✅ Disciplines**: Civil, Architecture, MEP, Structural, Landscape, Survey, etc.
- **✅ Templates**: Pre-built project phases and workflows
- **✅ Tags**: RFI, Submittal, Permit, Review, Survey, Utility, Stormwater
- **✅ Workload Management**: Track person assignments and capacity

### Data Management
- **✅ Local Storage**: Automatic project persistence
- **✅ Import/Export**: JSON and CSV export capabilities
- **✅ Undo/Redo**: Full history tracking
- **✅ Project Management**: Multiple project support

### User Interface
- **✅ Keyboard Shortcuts**: N (Task), M (Milestone), D (Deliverable), P (Person), L (Link), Delete, etc.
- **✅ Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface with Tailwind CSS
- **✅ Context Menus**: Right-click functionality for nodes and edges
- **✅ Properties Panel**: Edit node and edge properties
- **✅ Conflict Panel**: Visual warnings for scheduling conflicts

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Custom Hooks** for state management and side effects
- **Date-fns** for date manipulation
- **UUID** for unique ID generation

```

### Data Models
- **Project**: Container for nodes, edges, and settings
- **Node**: Milestones, Deliverables, Tasks, People with properties
- **Edge**: Dependencies between nodes with types
- **ViewSettings**: Canvas state, zoom, pan, grid settings
- **FilterSettings**: Search and filter configurations

## 🎨 User Experience

### Sample Project
The app starts with a sample "Subdivision – Oak Ridge" project including:
- **Milestones**: 30%, 60%, 90% Design, Permit Issued
- **Deliverables**: Site Plan, Utility Plan, Stormwater Report
- **Tasks**: Topo Survey, Geotech Report, Utility Coordination, etc.
- **People**: PM, Civil Engineer, Stormwater Engineer, Surveyor
- **Dependencies**: Visual connections showing project flow

### Interaction Patterns
- **Drag nodes** to reposition on canvas
- **Press L** to enter link mode, then click source and target nodes
- **Right-click** for context menus with edit options
- **Use keyboard shortcuts** for quick actions
- **Switch views** (1, 2, 3) to see different perspectives
- **Filter and search** using the sidebar

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
